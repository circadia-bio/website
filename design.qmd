The colours in this page were inspired by Hiroshige's woodblock print *Sailing Boats Returning to Yabase, Lake Biwa*.

*Sailing Boats Returning to Yabase, Lake Biwa.
Utagawa Hiroshige (Japanese).
ca. 1835*

The picture is composed by yellow and blue tones, which are relevant in the context of 
rhythmicity and chronobiology. We derived six tones on a divergent palette from Hiroshige's print. The palette is shown below.

Our logo also explores the dychotomy between day and night, light and darkness, yellow and blue light - linking these to circadian rhythms, with a wave-like symbol often used to illustrate *'zeitgebers'* (synchronisers). The logo is shown below.
