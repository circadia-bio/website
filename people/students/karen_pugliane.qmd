## Biography

I’m a PhD candidate in Psychobiology at UFRN, and my passion for building knowledge through science began when I was 16 years old. I discovered chronobiology in 2014 and have been dedicated to researching biological rhythms ever since. With a background in Psychology, Neuroscience, and Food Technology, I’ve integrated behavior, physiology, and data science throughout my academic journey, gaining experience in animal models, human studies, and Python-based analysis. Currently, I study circadian rhythms in blind individuals living in Northeast Brazil. As a visiting scholar at Northumbria University, I further developed my skills in data analysis with a focus on chronobiology, exploring new tools and methodologies to investigate biological rhythms. My main interest focuses on understanding circadian rhythmicity through a multidisciplinary perspective.
