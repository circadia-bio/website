## Biography

Having previously worked in education, I rediscovered the joys of research while completing my master’s degree. I am currently studying for my PhD in Computer Science at Northumbria University, investigating how actigraphy can be used to provide contextual information for neuroimaging. My research interests include wearable sensors and the impact of sleep on the brain.
