## Biography

Dr. Nick (Nicolaas) Puts is a Senior Lecturer in the Department of Forensic and Neurodevelopmental Sciences at the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London. He leads the ["Sensory InPuts" lab](https://inputslab.com), focusing on sensory processing in both typical and atypical neurodevelopment. The lab employs methods such as psychophysics and Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy (MRS) to study sensory processing differences in children with neurodevelopmental conditions, including autism, ADHD, and Tourette syndrome. The ultimate goal is to understand the biological nature of sensory difficulties and identify biomarkers that could inform personalized diagnosis, support, and intervention strategies.

Dr. Puts completed his BSc in Biology and MSc in Cognitive Neuroscience at Utrecht University in the Netherlands. He earned his PhD at Cardiff University, UK. Following his doctoral studies, he worked as a postdoctoral fellow and later as an Assistant Professor in the Department of Radiology at Johns Hopkins University in the USA. He joined King's College London in January 2020.

Beyond his research, Dr. Puts is committed to supporting junior scientists in their career development. He developed an Individual Development Plan and served as the first appointed Postdoc Program Director in his department at Johns Hopkins University. At King's College London, he directs the Health Science Doctoral Training Centre and is actively involved in mentorship and professional development initiatives within the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience.
