## Biography

I can describe myself as a physiologist shaped by several years of intensive chronobiology. I am an Assistant Professor in Sleep Science at Northumbria University, where my research interests include the neurophysiology of sleep, circadian rhythms, and mental health. I am particularly focussed on developing new approaches to physiological and behavioural signal processing.
